# DIABATES_PREDICTION_MODEL
Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning
Overview
This project aims to predict diabetes risk using various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. The dataset is preprocessed, and different models are evaluated to determine the most effective approach for classification.
